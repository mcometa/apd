### How to build from the source?

1. You must have nodejs and npm installed.
2. Run `npm install` to install all the required development dependencies.
3. Run `bower install` to install all the bower components.
4. Once finished installing, run `gulp sass` if you want to compile the SCSS files, `gulp serve` runs a local webserver and opens up a browser tab using your default internet web browser.
